# Taller Challenge JS

Those are my notes for the Taller Challenge

* Should I create a user model or is it part of the requirements?
* I'll assume that I can use commits to version the progress.
* Let's start with the scaffold for books and then iterate.
* Once the base is set up, let's work on the reserve endpoint.
